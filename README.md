## Description

This project was my first experience working in group with other people, and we didn't know Redux and API context yet.In this project we created a simplified version of an online store, developing it using Kanban. It is possible to search products by terms and categories from Mercado Livre's API, interact with the searched products in order to add and remove them from a shopping cart, view details and previous ratings of a product, as well as create new ratings, and finally, finalize the purchase (simulated).
